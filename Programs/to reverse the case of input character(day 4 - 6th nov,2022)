/// to reverse the case of input character


// if we want to reverse the  case of input character then islower() under #include<ctype.h> header file .
//Through this we can check character is lowercase or not.

//through scanf and getchar we can enter character

toupper  is used to convert the character in uppercase


#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char ch;
    printf("Enter a character:");
    // through getchar we can enter character
    ch=getchar();
    check is entered character is lowercase or not 
    if(islower(ch))
    // if entered character is lowercase then it convert into uppercase 
    putchar(toupper(ch));
    else
    //otherwise else case will executed(if entered character is in capital) 
    printf("%c is lowercase",tolower(ch));
    return 0;
