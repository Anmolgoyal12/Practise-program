*/ Basic ifelse condition program
    The if-else statement in C is used to perform the operations based on some specific condition. 
    The operations specified in if block are executed if and only if the given condition is true.
    
    
    //There are the following variants of if statement in C language.

        If statement
        If-else statement
        If else-if ladder
        Nested if
        
        
        If statemnt
        The if statement is used to check some given condition and perform some operations depending upon the correctness of that condition. 
        
        Syntax:
        
        if(expression){  
        //code to be executed  
        }
        
        IF statement
        #include<stdio.h>    
        int main(){    
        int number=0;    
        printf("Enter a number:");    
        scanf("%d",&number);    
      if(number%2==0){    
      printf("%d is even number",number);    
      }    
      return 0;  
      }
      
                          IF else statement
      If-else Statement
The if-else statement is used to perform two operations for a single condition. 
The if-else statement is an extension to the if statement using which, we can perform two different operations, i.e., 

 one is for the correctness of that condition, and the other is for the incorrectness of the condition. 
 Here, we must notice that if and else block cannot be executed simiulteneously.
 
 if(expression){  
//code to be executed if condition is true  
}else{  
//code to be executed if condition is false  
}  



            If else if-statement
       
      The if-else-if ladder statement is an extension to the if-else statement. 
      It is used in the scenario where there are multiple cases to be performed for different conditions. 
      In if-else-if ladder statement, if a condition is true then the statements defined in the if block will be executed, otherwise if some other condition is true then the 
      statements defined in the else-if block will be executed, at the last if none of the condition is true then the statements defined in the else block will be executed.
      
      There are multiple else-if blocks possible. 
      It is similar to the switch case statement where the default is executed instead of else block if none of the cases is matched.
      
      
      if(condition1){  
    //code to be executed if condition1 is true  
      }else if(condition2){  
    //code to be executed if condition2 is true  
  }  
else if(condition3){  
//code to be executed if condition3 is true  
}  
...  
else{  
//code to be executed if all the conditions are false  
}  
          
                
                #include<stdio.h>    
            int main(){    
            int number=0;    
        printf("enter a number:");    
        scanf("%d",&number);     
        if(number==10){    
      printf("number is equals to 10");    
          }    
        else if(number==50){    
        printf("number is equal to 50");    
        }    
        else if(number==100){    
        printf("number is equal to 100");    
        }    
      else{    
        printf("number is not equal to 10, 50 or 100");    
      }    
      return 0;  
        }
